@"Version 3.0.35.0
- Fixed WebView pages staying open after navigating away so each page's WebView shuts down until that page is opened again.
- Fixed opening movie files directly from File Explorer with Zink so file activation now reaches the video player instead of hanging on the startup loading screen.
- Added support for media paths passed through Explorer command-line launches as well as packaged Windows file activation.
- Fixed the startup overlay so it clears immediately when a video or music file is opened directly with Zink.
- Added real timeouts to video and audio metadata probing so slow or unusual movie files cannot leave the app waiting forever before playback.
- Fixed direct-open movie playback hanging on the video player page by keeping Windows-playable AAC and other supported audio streams on the native Windows media path instead of starting the custom FFmpeg audio pipe."

                    Notes:
@"Version 3.0.34.0
- Added Duplicate Video Searcher to the Video section in the sidebar so duplicate videos in the Zink Video Library can be found in one place.
- Added duplicate video results grouped by matching video name and file size, with quick actions to play each video.
- Added Open file location for duplicate videos so Zink opens the folder containing the selected file and highlights it when Windows allows.
- Added a delete action for duplicate videos, including a custom Zink confirmation UI before removing the file.
- Added a Delete button to duplicate video results so unwanted copies can be removed directly from the Duplicate Video Searcher page.
- Added a custom Zink deletion confirmation after a duplicate video has been deleted.
- Added search to the Video Library page so films can be found by name, file type, folder, and duration.
- Fixed the Video Library file count so it stays on the first calculated total after navigating away and only updates when new files are found.
- Improved video subtitles so Zink now turns on one subtitle track at a time, supports matching sidecar subtitle files, and prevents duplicated caption text.
- Improved video audio track selection so films with cinema audio tracks can fall back to a Windows-playable audio track when available.
- Added live video scrubbing to the video player so moving the time bar updates the video frame in real time while choosing where to watch.
- Improved video seeking so playback can continue smoothly while dragging through the timeline.
- Added Zink video file thumbnails so videos opened by default with Zink can show a video-style Zink thumbnail in Windows.
- Updated the Zink video file overlay badge in File Explorer to use the refreshed Zink logo artwork.
- Fixed a Zink Connect browser issue where opening a YouTube video in a new window from a playing video could create a blank tab, break the original YouTube tab, or destabilise the browser.
- YouTube new-window requests now open as independent Zink Connect tabs and navigate directly to the requested video page.
- Prevented accidental YouTube embed-page redirects from causing video player configuration error 153.
- Fixed local MSIX package signing so Windows App Installer can verify the publisher certificate and enable the Install button.
- Updated the package certificate to match the app publisher identity and extended the local signing certificate validity to 2046.
- Improved the packaging setup so Visual Studio local package builds are signed by default while Store upload builds can still opt out when needed."

@"The Bugs in the Zink app that have been fixed in the new update. --
(Sorry for the delay in fixing this bug, it was a big one!) 
- Finally fixed the bug where the BBC radio stations would close before the player opened. The BBC radio stations will now open for sign-in and playback without closing early.
- Fixed a bug where audio would continue to play on any audio page after Zink was shut. Audio will now stop playing when Zink is closed.
- Fixed a bug where YouTube wasn't going into fullscreen mode when clicking the fullscreen button. YouTube videos will now go fullscreen correctly.
- Fixed a bug where TikTok videos were muted by default. Videos will now play with sound by default.
- Fixed a bug where starting audio (like a video on the YouTube page) and navigating to another page would keep playing the audio. Now it stops correctly.
- Fixed a bug where any radio playing on the Radio page stopped incorrectly when navigating away.
- Fixed a bug where audio playback didn't stop after leaving the Music Player page.
- Fixed a bug where playing a song and then going to the Music Library page to play another song wouldn't overwrite the previous track. The new song will now replace the old one.
- Fixed a bug where Zink wasn't shutting down properly when the close button was clicked. Zink will now shut down cleanly.
