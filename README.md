5. Build and run the app from Visual Studio.

## Command Line Build

Build the app for x64:

```powershell
dotnet build Zink.csproj -c Debug -p:Platform=x64 -p:RuntimeIdentifier=win-x64
```

Build a release package:

```powershell
.\Build-ZinkAppPackages.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platforms x64
```

Build packages for multiple platforms:

```powershell
.\Build-ZinkAppPackages.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platforms x64,arm64 -CreateBundle
```

Package output is written under:

```text
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Zink\PackageOutput
```

## Installing a Local Package

After creating an MSIX or MSIX bundle, install it with:

```powershell
.\Install-ZinkPackage.ps1
```

You can also pass explicit paths:

```powershell
.\Install-ZinkPackage.ps1 -PackagePath "C:\Path\To\Zink.msixbundle" -CertificatePath "C:\Path\To\Zink_TemporaryKey.cer"
```

```text
FrancisHayle.Zink-MusicVideoPlayer
```

The project is configured for Windows desktop packaging, background media playback, global media control, graphics capture, microphone access, and startup task support.

## Development Notes

- Keep generated output out of source control. Build folders such as `bin/`, `obj/`, `x64/`, `BundleArtifacts/`, `Logs/`, and Visual Studio cache files are ignored.
- Use `Zink.csproj` as the source of truth for package references, app versioning, and MSIX settings.
- Some recording and native calling features depend on native DLLs being available for the selected platform.
